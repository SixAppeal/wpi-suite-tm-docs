# Managing Tasks

Once you have figured out how to create tasks using the Task Manager, you now need to understand how to edit and move your tasks to new stages. This section will show you how to use these features:

## Editing Existing Tasks

You can edit any existing task in order add or update the task's details. A task can contain the following:
* Title - the name given to the task

* Description - Explanation of what the task is in more detail

* Due Date - Allows a user to set a date that the task should be completed by

* Estimated Effort - How much effort you predict a task will require

* Actual Effort - How much effort the task actually required

* Assigned Members - Users who are assigned to working on the task

* History - An ordered list of all activity/ changes made to a task

* Comments - Users can comment on any task

### How to Access the Edit View

Editing a task takes place in the sidebar on the right of the screen. 

1. To access this task edit view, double click on the task you would like to edit. This will open an edit tab in the sidebar. This edit view is signified by the pencil icon

### Changing the Title and Description

The title and description of a task can be changed at any time. This process is similar to creating a new task.

1. Type the new title or description in the appropriately labeled text field
    * Please note that changing to a blank title or description is not allowed, as these are required fields. An error message will appear and upon closing the edit view, these changes will not be saved.

### Adding a Due Date
1. Below the description text field is a drop down menu labeled "Due Date". The original due date will be displayed in the box
1. Click the drop down icon next to the listed date to open a monthly calendar view. This will show the current month.
1. Click the left "<" or right ">" arrow buttons to change the month that you are viewing.
    * Note that due dates may be before or after the current date. This allows you to retroactively keep track of any tasks
    * You can click on the link at the bottom of the calendar which says "Today is __" to navigate to the current month
1. When you have navigated to the desired month, click on the day that you like to  set as the due date.
1. Clicking on a date will close the calendar view and display this new due date in the drop down menu
    * The date will be displayed as "Day of the week dd/mm/yyyy" (ex: Sat 01/01/2011)
1. You may also change the due date by typing your desired date in the box next to the drop down icon
    * The due date field accepts numerical dates entered in the form of "day/month/year"

### Adding Estimated and Actual Effort
Adding estimated and actual effort follows the same process:

1. Below the due date field you will find boxes to enter estimated and actual effort, respectively. By default both estimated and actual effort are set to 1

1. You may type any positive integer value into these boxes. (Efforts may not be negative or zero and attempting to do this will result in an error message)

1. Alternatively you may use the up or down arrows next to the boxes to select your desired effort. (Once again a negative or zero effort will result in an error)

### Assigning and Unassigning Members
Members are listed as usernames of those who have logged in to use your Task Manager

1. The fields to assign and unassign members to a task are listed below the effort boxes.

1. To assign a member, select the username of the person you would like in the box labeled "Members" by clicking on it
    * All usernames associated with your Task Manager will be listed here unless they have already been assigned to the task

1. Once a username is selected, press the ">>" button to the right to move the username into the "Assigned" box located on the other side of the buttons

1. If you would like to unassign any members, click on their username in the "Assigned" box

1. Press the "<<" button located below the ">>" button to move the username back to the "Members" list

## Associated Requirements
Any requirement listed in WPISuite's Requirement Manager can be linked to a task

1. Click the drop down menu labeled "Associated Requirement" (By default the associated requirement box is left empty)
    * This will display a list of all requirements located in the Requirement Manager

1. Click on the requirement that you would like the task to be associated with
    * This will display the selected requirement in the box provided

1. Click the button labeled "Associate" located below the associated requirement box, to link the task to that requirement

1. You can also click the button labeled "View" located next to the "Associate" button to view the selected requirement
     * Clicking this button will take you to the specific requirement listed in Requirement Manager

### Commenting on a Task
Users can comment on a task in the edit view as well and see any comments that a task has

1. Locate the "Comments" tab in the edit view. This is to the right of the title title field next to the tab labeled "History"

1. By default, the history tab is the current tab selected. Click on "Comments" to switch to the comment tab

1. Within the tab, there is the word "Comments" located in the top left. All user comments will appear below this in the format "username: comment"

1. Below this space to display comments there is a white text field accompanied by a button labeled "Save"

1. Type your comment in the text field

1. Press the save button when you have finished typing your comment
    *This will save and display the comment that you have written in the space provided above
    * Comments are displayed in order and new comments will always be placed below existing ones

### Keeping Track of Task History
Task history keeps track of any changes and activity made to the task, including comments. The history tab is open by default

1. In the "History" tab you will find the "Task History" space. Below this label all changes made to a task will be shown
    * Changes will be display with the message "The ____ was changed to ______" (ex: The Title was changed to Task 1)
    * New comments will be displayed as "username made a comment!"

1. The history shows changes in the order to which they were made. Newer change will be added below existing history items

### Saving Your Changes
Once you have edited your task to its desired details you can close the task and your changes will be saved

1. The "Close" button is located below the "Associate" button

1. Pressing the close button will close the edit view in the sidebar and save your changes
    * You will notice that the due date that you assigned to the task is now listed next to the task's title on the task card
    * If you double click on your task again, you will notice that the changes were saved and the history has been updated to reflect these changes

## Moving Tasks (Drag and Drop)
Another way to manage your tasks is to be able to change what stage they are in as you are progressing through your workflow. This can be accomplished by simply dragging and dropping the desired task into the proper stage:

1. Select the task you would like to move by clicking on  it and holding

1. Drag the task to its desired stage and release the task once you moved your cursor to an appropriate spot
    * The cursor will show you whether or not you have chosen a spot that a task can be dragged to

1. After releasing your cursor, the task will move into the new stage

You may also use the drag and drop feature to change the  order of the tasks within a stage. This can be useful to show task priority, or to add organization to the tasks in a column

1. Select a task to drag in the same way as above. 
    * You may drag any task to the bottom of the list of tasks to change the order within a stage

1. After releasing the cursor, you will see the task move down the list into its new spot in the stage
