# Other Features

WPISuite's Task Manager also has some additional features to enhance your user experience:

## Toggle Sidebar

The sidebar contains many of the key features of the Task Manager, but sometimes it can get in the way of viewing your full workflow or dragging and dropping a task into certain columns. You may choose to collapse the sidebar at any time:

1. In the toolbar, located next to the help button, is the button labeled "Toggle Sidebar"

1. Clicking the "Toggle Sidebar" button when the sidebar is open collapses the sidebar
    * The side bar is no longer visible in the Task Manager; however, doing anything that requires the sidebar will reopen the sidebar

1. Clicking the "Toggle Sidebar" button again will reopen the sidebar and the tab that was open when you collapsed the sidebar will be the tab selected

## Statistics

Another useful feature of the Task Manager is the ability to generate statistics based on the tasked your team has completed. This option to generate statistics is found in the statistics tab in the sidebar

1. In the sidebar, click the statistics tab signified by a graph icon (This tab is located below the column tab)
    * This will open the statistics view

1. Select the start date for the time period that you wish to gather statistics from
    * In the box labeled "Start Date", select the date you wish to begin getting statistics on by pressing the calendar button or typing in a date in the form (m/d/yy)

1. Select the end date for the time period that you wish to gather statistics from (Note that you cannot choose an end date that is before the start date or you will receive an error message)    
    * In the box labeled "End Date", select the last date you wish to generate statistics on by pressing the calendar button or typing in a date in the form (m/d/yy)

1. Select the members you wish to gather statistics on (By default, all users are selected to generate statistics)
    * Add a user from the "Members" box to the "Selected" box by clicking on the desired username and pressing the right arrow ">>" button. The user will now appear in the "Selected" members box
    * Remove a user you do not want statistics on by clicking the desired username and pressing the left arrow "<<" button. This will move the user to the "Members" box

1. Choose where you would like to save the statistics reports on your computer by pressing the "Choose File Path" button
    * This will open a window allowing you to select the directory you would like the reports to be saved in (Note that the directory must be a newly made directory or an empty directory in order to store the reports)

1. Once you have chosen your desired directory, the file path will be listed in the box labeled "Directory to Create"

1. Press the "Create" button to generate the statistics reports for your chosen team members, during the desired period of time (Note that the "Create" button will not be clickable unless the "Directory to Create" lists a new or empty directory

1. Going to the directory in your computer and opening the files, you will find statistics on the given users during the selected period of time
    * These include statistics on a user's effort, task activity and more

## Multiple Users at Once

The most important added feature of Task Manager is its ability to accommodate multiple users working in the same project at once. This means that you can create a task and your teammate will see the task as soon as it has been created. Users are restricted from both trying to edit or archive a task that someone else is currently working with to prevent one user's changes from being processed but not the other's
