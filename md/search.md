# Searching the Task Manager

Task Manager comes with a search bar feature that allows you to find the tasks you have created. The search feature is located in the sidebar and is the tab open by default when you begin to use your Task Manager. Searching allows you to find a specific task you are looking for without having to manually rad through every task you have created. The search feature also allows you to search through archived tasks that are no longer in the Task Manager view. This allows you to also look at their details and edit a task that you otherwise would not see.

## How to Search

1. Click on the search tab signified by the "magnifying glass icon" located in the sidebar. This is the first tab and by default the initial tab that is open in Task Manager.

1. Select whether you would like to search through archived or unarchived tasks
    * By default, the search is set to search through all unarchived tasks in Task Manager

1. If you would like to search through archived tasks, check the box labeled "Archived Tasks"
    * This will display all archived tasks in the space provided below

1. At the top of the search tab is a text field where you can begin typing your desired search
    * As you type, the search tab populates with results of tasks that match your search. As you type more, the search results will refine
    * The search tab will show any task whose title, description, or assigned members matches the search criteria. The tasks are displayed in task cards as they would be in a stage column
    * The tasks shown in the search results are prioritized by matching title, then description, then finally members

1. Double click a task to open that task's edit view in the sidebar. You will be brought to the edit view where you can see the task's details and change information

Note: the search feature filters out common words such as: a, is, the, etc. This is done to help refine your search results better and make it easier to find the specific task you are looking for
