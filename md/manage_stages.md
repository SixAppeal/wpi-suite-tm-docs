# Managing Stages

Task Manager comes with four default stages set for you to use. These are "New", "Scheduled", "In Progress", and "Completed". These stages are set to get you started with using a simple workflow process. These stages are not fixed and can be changed, added to, or removed to better fit your team's workflow.

## Creating Your Own Stages

As a user you can choose to create your own stages. This will be done in the "Column Edit View" located in the sidebar:

1. In the sidebar on the right, click the second tab with the image of "three columns". This will open the column edit view
1. Type the name of the stage you would like to create in the text field at top of column edit view. 
    * This box is initially outlined in red. Similarly to adding a title or description, a stage name must be filled in with appropriate characters in order for a new stage to be made
1. Once you have typed the desired stage name, press the button labeled "Create Stage" located to the right of the text field (Note that this button only becomes active if a proper stage name has been typed in)
    * If a stage already exists with that name, nothing will change when you press the button
    * The new stage name will appear in the space below along with all the other existing stages. The new stage name will be listed last
    * The stage will be added as a new column in the Task Manager, positioned by default as the right most column
    * The new stage name will be available in the Select Stage drop down menu when creating a new task

## Changing the Order of Columns
As previously mentioned, any new stage added will be shown as the right most column in the Task Manager. This may not always be the ideal location for a stage based on your workflow. Here we will show you how to move a stage to a different point in the workflow:

1. Click on the name of the stage in the list of stages that you would like to move to a different location.

1. At the very bottom of the column edit view, there are two buttons. These symbolize up and down arrows and can be used to move a stage to a new place in the workflow

1. Press the up arrow to move the stage name up one in the list of stages (If the stage is the first stage already, nothing will change)
    * The stage name will appear in its new location in the list, one spot higher than initially
    * The column of the stage will shift to the left one spot
1. Press the down arrow to move the stage name down one in the list of stages (If the stage is the last stage already, nothing will change)
    * The stage name will appear in its new location in the list, one spot lower than initially
    * The column of the stage will shift to the right one spot

## Editing Stage Names

Within the column edit view, the names of the stages can be changed at any time:

1. Click on the name of the stage listed that you wish to change. This will highlight the stage name you chose
1. At the bottom of the sidebar, type the stage's new name in the text field located above the up arrow (Note that this text field cannot be type in unless a stage name has been selected from the list)
    * You cannot change the name of a stage to be blank. This will not allow you to save your change
1. When you have typed the desired stage name, press the "Edit Name" button to the right of the text field to update the stage name (Note that this button will not be active unless a stage name is selected)
    * The new stage name will appear in the place of the old stage name within the column edit view
    * The stage name will be updated at the top of the corresponding column
    * The new stage name will replace the old stage name in the create task tab

## Removing Stages

If you decide you no longer want a stage to be a part of your workflow, you may delete a stage in the column edit view as well:

1. Click on the stage name of the stage you would like to delete in the column edit view list (Note that you can only delete one stage at a time)
1. Press your keyboard's "delete" key
    * This will delete the stage name from the list
    * This will delete the stage's column from the workflow
    * The stage name will no longer be in the drop down menu in the create task tab
