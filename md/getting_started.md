# Getting Started with WPISuite Task Manager

Here you will find some basic aspects to know before using WPISuite's Task Manager. Task Manager is a product meant to be used by software engineering students to help manage their team's workflow. The initial columns that we have provided in Task Manager are made to best accommodate a typical workflow for software engineering teams but may be changed fit your own personal workflow process.

## Creating and Archiving Tasks

### Creating a Task

The first step toward using our Task Manager (with the initial stages that we have set for you), is to create a task:

1. In the toolbar at the top of the Task Manager, the left most button is labeled "Create Task". 
    * Clicking on this button will open a new tab in the side bar located on the right. (Note that only one "Create Task" tab can be can be opened initially)
    * In the "+" tab in the sidebar, you may begin creating your task
1. To name the task, type the desired name in the text field labeled "Title" (Note that adding a space in the text field is not a valid title and an error message will appear)
1. To add a description to the task, type the desired description in the text field labeled "Description" (Note that, similarly to adding a title, adding spaces is not considered a valid description and an error message will appear)
1. Below the description box you may add a "Due Date" in the box provided (m/d/yy), or select a date by pressing the calendar button (Note that due dates may be before or after the current date)
    * Click the drop down icon next to the listed date to open a monthly calendar view. This will show the current month.
    * Click the left "<" or right ">" arrow buttons to change the month that you are viewing.
1. You may also choose which stage the task will be placed in. This is done by clicking the drop down menu titled "Stage". 
    * You may click on any stage listed in the drop down menu to assign a task to begin in that stage. By default, tasks are set to be placed in the "New" stage. 
1. Below the area to select a stage there are two buttons, "Create" and "Cancel". These buttons allow you to create the task or cancel the task you had started to make
    * The "Create" button will only be usable after you have given your task a proper title, description and due date. After filling in these required fields, you may select the "Create" button. This will put your task into the stage that you have chosen.
    * You may also choose to cancel the task you are creating at any time by pressing the "Cancel" button. This will close the current tab in the sidebar, and the task you were creating will not be saved.
1. Once you have created your task, the tab you were working in will close. You can now find your task listed in the column corresponding to the stage you selected. Both the title of the task and the due date will be displayed here.

### Archiving a Task

Now that you can create a task, it is also important to know how to remove a task from Task Manager. One nice feature of the Task Manager is that you cannot permanently delete a task, but rather you can choose to "archive" it. Archiving a task makes the task no longer visible within the Task Manager; however, it is still accessible and its information is not lost. Here is how to archive a task:

1. Select the task that you wish archive by double clicking on it within the column it is located
    * Double clicking on a task will open the task's details in a new tab (shown by a pencil icon) in the sidebar
1. At the bottom of this tab, there are two buttons located below all of the task's details, "Archive" and "Close". Press the "Archive" button to archive the task.
    * Clicking the "Archive" button will close the current tab and remove the task that you selected from the stage that it was located in
1. The task is now no longer visible in the Task Manager, but the task and its details are still saved by the Task Manager

This section only touches on two of the basic, but important, features of the Task Manager. The rest of the features will be covered in subsequent sections.
